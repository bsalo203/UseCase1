Countries API Description

The "Countries" API provides a straightforward and intuitive way to retrieve information about countries. Exposed via the endpoint api/Countries, it utilizes a RESTful design to fetch country data based on various parameters. Clients can make a simple HTTP GET request to retrieve all country details, or apply filters to narrow down the results based on specific criteria like CountryName, PopulationInMillions, SortByCountryName, and Limit. Notably, the API's core logic depends on an injected service, ICountryService, which manages the retrieval, filtering, sorting, and limitation of records. In cases where a valid request is made, a list of countries matching the criteria is returned in the response. However, if an error occurs during processing, the API will provide a concise error message detailing the problem.

The API ensures flexibility and precision by allowing multiple filter combinations. For instance, users can sort countries by name and simultaneously set a maximum limit on the number of records. Additionally, the API is robust in terms of error handling; if there's an exception during the operation, it will not crash but instead provide meaningful feedback to the client. This makes it a reliable tool for developers and applications in need of dynamic country-related data.

Countries API Readme
Application Description
The Countries API is designed to provide comprehensive data about countries from all around the world. The core of this API revolves around an endpoint that fetches country information, offering capabilities to filter, sort, and limit results based on various criteria. By leveraging a service-driven architecture, the API seamlessly interfaces with the ICountryService to handle data retrieval and manipulation, ensuring optimized performance and maintainability. Clients can make intuitive GET requests to extract country details either in bulk or based on specific attributes, making it versatile for diverse application needs.

The underlying architecture is robust, prioritizing data integrity and error handling. If any exception arises during the processing of a request, the API ensures to provide a descriptive error message, guiding the client in making corrections. This results in a reliable and user-friendly experience for developers and applications harnessing the power of country-related data.
